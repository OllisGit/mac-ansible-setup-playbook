# Mac Development Ansible Playbook

This playbook installs and configures most of the software I use on my Mac for web and software development.

## Short overview how it works

1. Download ````install.sh```` from github-master (see below sh/curl-command)
2. The script does the following:
    - check/install for "Apple Command Line tools"
    - check/install "Homebrew"
    - check/install(via brew) "Ansible"
    - clone ````this git```` to local folder nammed ````/Users/<yourName>/.setup````
3. Execute the ansible-playbook: ````./main.yml````. It includes the following tasks/roles:
    - DockUtil      Remove/Add/Move Items releated to Dock-Bar

Depending on your setup requirments you need to change the following files:

| Filename | Content |
|----------|---------|
| vars/main.yml                | Update dotfile_repo_username                                   |
| vars/dockutil.yml            | Lists all DockItems you want                                   |
| vars/homebrew.yml            | Lists all Application you want to install via brew/cask        |
| tasks/main.yml                | oy-my-zsh, dotfiles, Monolingual (removes languages)          |
| scripts/system_settings.sh    | System Settings like hide Spotlight-Icon, etc                 |

## Installation

### Fast Install

If you'd like to start with my default list of tools and apps (see Included Apps/Config below), then simply install with;

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MNicks/mac-dev-playbook/master/install.sh)"

You can always customize the install after-the-fact (see below), and re-run the playbook. It will skip over any installed apps.

### Custom Install

If you want to add/remove to the list of apps/utils installed, its pretty straightforward.

As above, download and bootstrap the script. But stop it before it starts ansible, and edit the playbook as desired, before re-running ansible.

1. Grab and start the bootstrap script. Let it install the prereqs and clone the full `~/.setup` repo locally...

      sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MNicks/mac-dev-playbook/master/install.sh)"


1. Stop the script (Ctrl+C) when ansible asks for the a 'sudo' password.

        ```
        Changing to laptop repo dir ...

        Running ansible playbook ...
        SUDO password:  ^c

        ```

1. Change into the cloned repo dir

        `cd ~/.setup`

1. Edit ./vars/vars-homebrew.yml and add/remove the apps/utils you want.

        `vi ./vars/vars-homebrew.yml`

1. Kick off ansible manually

        `ansible-playbook main.yml -i hosts --ask-sudo-pass -vvvv`

You can do this as many times as you like and re-run the `ansible-playbook` command. Ansible is smart enough to skip installed apps, so subsequent runs are super fast.

### System Settings

It also installs a few useful system preferences/settings/tweaks with a toned-down version of Matt Mueller's [OSX-for Hackers script](https://gist.github.com/MatthewMueller/e22d9840f9ea2fee4716).

It does some reasonably gnarly stuff e.g.

  - hide spotlight icon
  - disable app Gate Keeper
  - change stand-by delay from 1hr to 12hrs.
  - Set trackpad tracking rate.
  - Set mouse tracking rate.
  - and lots more...

so you need read it very carefully first. (see scripts/system_settings.sh)

### User Preferences

In addition it user specific preferences (dotfiles) will pulled from Github as well

1. Grabbing [thoughttbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) repo, saves it in `~/src_dotfiles/thoughtbot/dotfiles` and symlinks it to ~/dotfiles.

1. Grabbing [MNicks/dotfiles](https://github.com/MNicks/dotfiles) repo, saves it in `~/src_dotfiles/MNicks/dotfiles` and symlinks it to ~/dotfiles-local

1. Running `rcup` to initialize your dotfiles.

You probably want to change the `dotfile_repo_username` variable in `vars/main.yml`to match your github username and therefore you personal dotfiles :-)
